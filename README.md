# Sound Demixing Project
This project aims to separate different sound sources from a mixed audio recording using two techniques: spatial clustering using Mixture of Gaussian and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The project consists of a report, source code, and an explanation video.

### Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run the source code, you will need the following libraries installed:

```
nussl
numpy
```

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
Copy code
pip install nussl numpy 
```

### Installing
To get a copy of the project, you can either download the source code or clone the repository using git:

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/adityapwr/speech-processing.git
```

### Usage
Click on open in colab: musicdemixing_speechprocessing.ipynb

### Report
The report provides an overview of the project, including the problem statement, methodology, and results. It also includes visualizations of the separated sound sources using both techniques.

### Explanation Video
The explanation video provides a detailed walkthrough of the project, including the problem statement, methodology, and results. It also includes visualizations of the separated sound sources using both techniques. (https://youtu.be/_Go6cv-EJQU)
